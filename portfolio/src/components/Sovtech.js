          I would love to be a developer at sovtech becuase the comapnys specs are aligned to my values in life.
          I see an oportunity to grow and broaden my skills in the development industry through this internship.
          I will contribute the skills that I have and still am about to acquire to the growth of the comapny as I am 
          open to learning new skills everyday.

            <br></br>

            I am excited about the possibilty of learning from and contributing to the team by applying my communication, teamwork
            and decision-making skills. My focus is to utilize my skills in programming in order to make a 
            positive impact on the overall organization. I enjoy being challenged , being a team player and
            brainstorming project strategies. 

            <br></br>

            continuing to enchance the excellent reputation of SovTech
